2                   onions, quartered longitudinally
2 tbsp              salt
2 tbsp              pepper
2 cloves            garlic, sliced
1/2 cup             broth
1/2 cup             red wine

Oven 325 F

Make sure to use chuck roast.  Round roast will not work.  Rib roast may work,
but there are probably better ways to cook it.

Prepare dutch oven.  Brush a layer of oil.  Put rosemary, thyme, and garlic on
the bottom of the dutch oven.

Brown carrots, celery, and onions, separately.  Put them aside.

Rub some oil in the roast.  Cover roast with salt and pepper on all sides.  

Sear roast, 1 min on each side.  For best results, use a pan like cast iron
which can get really hot.  If the pan is not hot enough, the meat will not
brown correctly, which leads to prolonged cooking, which leads to smoke and
burnt bits and pieces in the pan.

Put the roast in the dutch oven.

Deglaze the pan with red wine.  Put red wine in the dutch oven.  Make sure to
scrape as much as possible off the pan.  That is where the flavor is.

Continue to deglaze with broth.  Put broth in the dutch oven.

Put the vegetables in the dutch oven on top of the roast.  Seal the dutch oven
tight so the meat will stay moist.

Put the dutch oven in the baking oven.  After one hour, lower heat to 275 F.
Cook another 2 to 3 hours.
